Title: Rcpp Package Illustrating Header-Only Access to NLopt
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: An example package which shows use of NLopt functionality from
 C++ via Rcpp without requiring linking, and relying just on nloptr thanks
 to the exporting API added there by Jelmer Ypma. This package is a fully
 functioning, updated, and expanded version of the initial example by
 Julien Chiquet at https://github.com/jchiquet/RcppArmadilloNLoptExample
 also containing a large earlier pull request of mine.
