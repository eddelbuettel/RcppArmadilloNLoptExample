#### What Is This About?

This is a mostly-local experimental repo where I once tried to offer help to
[this repository](https://github.com/jchiquet/RcppArmadilloNLoptExample)
which had been struggling with an integration between RcppArmadillo and
nloptr.

This now contains two working packages showing the integration but one relies
on an external nlopt installation and links to it, and the other takes
advantage of the API exporting header `nloptrAPI.h` and does _not_ require an
external library.
